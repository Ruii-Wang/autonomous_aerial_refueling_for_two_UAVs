# Autonomous Aerial Refueling for Two UAVs

## This repository contains the formal structure of a holon for all plant agents and local requirements.
## The results of multi-level supervisory control for the autonomous aerial refueling control problem are saved. For a comparison, the results of monolithic supervisory control based on STS are also saved.

* "holons" contains all holons of the plant agent and local requirement
* "control_functions/mono" contains the control functions of monolithic supervisor f
* "control_functions/node_00" contains the control functions of local supervisor g_00
* "control_functions/node_01" contains the control functions of local supervisor g_01
* "control_functions/node_1" contains the control functions of local supervisor g_1
* "control_functions/node_2" contains the control functions of local supervisor g_2
* "control_functions/node_3" contains the control functions of local supervisor g_3
